Database security concerns the use of a broad range of information security controls to protect databases  against compromises of their confidentiality, integrity and availability. It involves various types or categories of controls, such as technical, procedural/administrative and physical. Database security is a specialist topic within the broader realms of computer security,information security and risk management .

From the outset, Oracle has delivered the industry's most advanced technology to safeguard data at the source the database.
Oracle provides a comprehensive portfolio of security solutions to ensure data privacy, protect against insider threats, and enable regulatory compliance for both Oracle and non-Oracle databases. Oracle's powerful preventive and detective security controls include database activity monitoring and blocking, privileged user and multifactor access control, data classification and discovery, transparent data encryption, consolidated auditing and reporting, secure configuration management, and data masking. With Oracle, customers can deploy reliable data security solutions that require no changes to existing applications, saving time and money.

Digital warfare and worldwide cyber attack rates are on the rise, and protection on corporate networks is even more crucial.
Databases are a key target for cybercriminals due to the often valuable nature of sensitive information locked away inside. Whether the data is financial or holds intellectual property and corporate secrets, hackers worldwide can profit from breaching a businesses' servers and plundering databases.

Secure business-critical databases from external, internal, and intra-database threats in real time with solutions that require no architecture changes, costly hardware, or database downtime. With database security software from Intel Security, you gain complete visibility into your overall database landscape and corresponding security posture, fully align database security policy administration practices, and efficiently maintain regulatory compliance. Each of our solutions are integrated with the McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator management console to provide centralized database security management.
The first step first step in accessing a database is logging in to the database server after the authentication process. If the authentication process in not configured properly, it becomes easy for the attacker to gain access in to the database. If the database consists of high-priority data, multiple-level authentications should be implemented to maximize the security level. Even if a normal username password authentication is implemented, we must make sure that the strength of the keywords used is high.
